# py3-auto-clicker

An auto clicker for Windows written in Python 3. 
This project was created in order to experiment with the [pywin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/) module, multithreading and clicker games like Clicker Heroes, Cookie Clicker etc. At this stage, *py3-auto-clicker* needs **Python 3** and **pywin32** to run properly.

By default clicks at roughly **100 times/second** however, you can modify this speed using the keybindings mentioned below.

Run it through Powershell or CMD with the command:
` python py3-auto-clicker.py ` 

Current *py3-auto-clicker* controls:
  * Start Auto-Clicking: **Shift + Q**
  * Stop Auto-Clicking: **Shift + W**
  * Increase Clicking Speed (Clicks/Second): **Shift + Up Arrow**
  * Decrease Clicking Speed (Clicks/Second): **Shift + Down Arrow**
  * Exit Program: **Ctrl + C**
